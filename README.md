# VAPT Portfolio

Professional penetration testing and vulnerability assessment case studies demonstrating real-world exploitation techniques, methodical security assessments, and business-aligned remediation strategies.

## 🎯 Overview

This portfolio showcases practical VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing) engagements conducted in controlled lab environments, following industry-standard frameworks like PTES and NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

**Methodology:** Reconnaissance → Scanning → Enumeration → Exploitation → Post-Exploitation → Reporting

## 📋 Case Studies

### 1. **Windows SMB EternalBlue Exploitation (MS17-010)**

**Target Environment:** Windows 7 SP1 (Unpatched)  
**Vulnerability:** CVE-2017-0144 (CVSS 9.3 - Critical)  
**Attack Surface:** SMB Protocol (Port 445)  
**Tools Used:** Nmap, Metasploit Framework, Kali Linux  
**Outcome:** Full system compromise, credential extraction, remediation roadmap

**What This Case Study Demonstrates:**
- Network reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning with Nmap
- Service enumeration and protocol analysis (SMB)
- Remote code execution exploitation (EternalBlue)
- Post-exploitation: privilege escalation and evidence collection
- Business impact assessment and CVSS scoring
- Framework-aligned remediation (NIST CSF, CIS Controls)
- Professional client-ready reporting
